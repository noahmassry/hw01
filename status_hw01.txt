4. What's the URL of your Github repository for this assignment?

5. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
All of it. I had trouble linking my subdomain. I had trouble altering
the nginx default file. I had trouble linking my server to my DNS and
back the other way. I couldn't find much help online and struggled 
throughout the assignment. There were no office hours, so I could not
even speak to a TA about my issues. I don't know how I will be able to
succeed in this class if I cannot even figure out this hw01.
